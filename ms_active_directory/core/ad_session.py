        Given an LDAP connection, a domain, and optional parameters relating to searches and multi-domain
        functionality, create an ADSession object.

        :param ldap_connection: An ldap3 Connection object representing the connection to LDAP servers within
                                the domain.
        :param domain: An ADDomain object representing the domain that we're communicating with.
        :param search_paging_size: Optional. The page size for paginated searches. If a search is expected to
                                   be able to have more than this many results, a paginated search will be
                                   performed. This is used as the page size in such searches. Changing this
                                   affects the balance between the number of queries made and the size of
                                   each query response in a large scale environment, and so it can be used
                                   to optimize behavior based on network topology and traffic.
                                   If not specified, defaults to 100.
        :param trusted_domain_cache_lifetime_seconds: Optional. How long to maintain our trusted domain cache in
                                                      seconds. The cache of trusted domain information exists because
                                                      trust relationships change infrequently, but will be used a lot
                                                      in searches and such when automatic traversal of trusts is
                                                      supported. Can be set to 0 to disable the cache.
